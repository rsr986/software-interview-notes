COGNIZANT
=========
1) Constructor injection or Setter injection => what is the difference (not syntax wise), when to use which.
2) Hibernate - explain the Caching mechanism. => what is cache -> cache is representation of database near application.
    * first level cache -> also called as session cache (by default enabled, and we can't disable) -> objects save in session -> once closes the session all will be discarded.
    * second level cache -> (global session) need to implement provider
    * when will cache expires -> first level cache expires when session expires. -> second level cache expiration can be configured in configuration file.
3) What are the advantages of ORM?
4) What is meant by Dialect?
5) What is meant by immutable class? the class which can't be modified is called immutable class => example -> String, all Wrapper classes
6) I have a class called Employee, and it has firstName and lastName variables. How you convert it to immutable class?
    * declare class as final, declare the variables as private and final, to initialize use constructor, and write getter method and don't write setter method.
7) As you can't modify immutable class, then what is the use of immutable class.
8) What is the purpose of hashcode and equals methods in Object class?
9) Have you used ConcurrentHashMap ?
10) What is advantage of Restful web services over SOAP web services?
11) Security wise which is best (soap or rest) ?
12) What kind of design patterns you use so far? -> singeton, factory, j2ee-> mvc, frontcontroller, dao, intercepting filters etc..
13) what is advantages of design patterns, why we have to use? -> design patterns give specific solution to specific type of problem.
14)

CISCO
=====
1) What is immutble class -> once created, the state of class can't be modified.
2) How you achieve that?
3) I have a class employee with variables like name, age, address, etc.. Now I want compare employee with name and age, how you can achieve that?
4) Select all employees order by name and age (i want sort by both)?
5) What is diff between HashSet and LinkedHashSet? => linkedhashset will be stored elemnts in order.
6) Is there collection key-value pair and key has to be in sorted order? yes TreeMap.
7) Suppose if I add the employee object to treemap, what would be the sorting? => it will give classcast exception, your employee key object must be comparable. emloyee class has to implement comparable interface.
8) What is the diff between wait and sleep? => in sleep thread will not release lock but wait, so we have to call wait method from synchronized context only.
9) what are the bean scopes are avilable in Spring => singleton, prototype, request, session, global session.
10) what is the diff between singleton and globalsession? => global session will be used in portlet..
11) what is the diff between prototype and request?  => prototype - each time new object will be created.
12) What is lazyloading?
13) what is the cascade attribute? =>
14) what are the values for cascade?
15)

MPHASIS
=======
1) two exceptions, one parent and one child exception. I have class A with m1(which throws parent exception) and m2 (which throws child exception).
    Now I am creating instance of class A and calling m1 method in try catch block, in catch block I am catching child exception.
    Now will this code compiles or not? => it will not compile, you need to catch parent exception.
2) What are the various stats of Hibernate Objects? => Transient , Persistent and Detached.
3) I have a table in database with id, name, age, department. Now I created a session and created employee object with id-1, name-dharmendra, age-20 and commited and detached.
    Now some one modified age to 25 in database. After 10 min I reattached the detached object and changed the age to 23 and merged and commited.
    Now What will be the age value in database.
4) Same programme, while merging I changed both id and age, Now what will be the values in database. (id is application generated.) -> will throw an exception?
5) How does hibernate work on objects?
6) How you aproch from requirements to build an application.
7) why do you need interfaces? (you got web, services, dao, database, then why do you need interfaces).
8) what are your negative points from your coding, etc..
9) Have you worked with logging.
10) Are you independent in coding?

NIIT
====
1) Have you used any tools for testing web services.
2) which protocol you used in your web services.
3) what is the diff between jdk and jre.
4) what is the diff between jar and war file? => war contains web content.
5) what tool you used for moving war file to production server?
6) what is the diff between abstract class and interface, give real example. In what scenario you use which one.
7) what is serialization?
8) what is diff between transient and static in serialization?
9) what is checked and unchecked exception.
10) why we use exception?
11) what is the finally block? if return from try block, then will finally block will be called?
12) what is synchronization? what is diff between runnable and Thread?
13) which java version you are using? what are the
      new features in java 1.5 => Enum new keyword, Hexadecimal floting point, Enhanced for loop,
        variable arguments, generics, scanner class, formatter class, getenv method in system class, autoboxing.
14) what is autoboxing.
15) what are new features in java 6 => not much, improved compiler related api, and improved xml processing, jdbc auto driver loading.
16) what are new features in java 7 => can represent binary number in java, and catching multiple exception in one catch block, dimond operator, try with resource, throw with type checking.
17) give name of some design patterns.
18) do you know how to create singleton design pattern?
19) what is WSDL? what is diff between soap based and rest based web services.
20) what is the servlet context object? => it is global and is only one. we can store variable which will be accessed by whole application.
21) how many instances of servlet context will be there? => only one.
22) what is the servlet config object ?
23) what are the implicit object in jsp?
24) what are the main features of Spring?
25) what is autowire?
26) what are the main interfaces in Spring? => applicationcontext, beanfactory, etc..
27) what is diff between application context and beanfactory => in beanfactory there is no annotaiton support,
      in beanfactory by default it is lazyloading, in applicatincontext it is by default aggressive loading.
      beanfactory does not support event handling, event publishing.
28) how you create bean objects?
29) what are main interfaces in Hiberenate => Configuration, Session, Transaction, Criteria, Query, sessionfactory, etc..
30) what is diff between load and get? =>
    load -> will first search in cache, if it is not found, then it will look in database, if it is not found then it thorw exception.
    get -> will always get data from database, if it is not found, it returns null.
    If you are not sure whether data is there in database, then use get method, if you are sure then use load method.
31) how you save data in database? => ..........
32) Object heirachy in Hibernate? => thourgh inheritence mapping.
33) you worked in sturts? how to configure?

35) how you implemtent validation? => ...........
36) what are actions in struts?

PHOTON
======
1) what are the collections you used?
2) I am using Hashmap, I am using Employee object as a key, any concerns?

11) suppose I have a url as part of my application which will get me to welcome page, how you implement that? ........

13) how you add session for controller, how you add varibales to session? ...... @Session, etc........
14) hibernate - by default will it load all objects? => no, it is lazyloading. Ok, then how to change that? => change lazy-init=false in xml.
15) how you were mappling - xml based or annotation based ?
16) how will I get automatically created sequence from a table to hibernate? .......
17) have ever used any templating like hibernate template, etc..?
18) how you implement hibernate template, there are two way, which one? ..........
